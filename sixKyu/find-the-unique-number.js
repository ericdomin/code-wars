/*Find the unique number 6kyu
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.*/

function findUniq(arr) {
    // do magic
   let a = arr.sort((a,b)=>a-b)
  return a[0]==a[1] ? a[a.length-1] : a[0]
  
  }
